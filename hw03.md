### Use of git is required

You are required to use git for this assignment.

To check out the homework assignment (you'll need to substitute the current four-digit year for YYYY, the current homework number for XX, and substitute your actual Github username):

* ssh YOUR_NETID@cl.linguistics.illinois.edu
* git clone https://github.com/YYYY-Fall-UIUC-LING402/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME-hwXX.git

Your workflow should be as follows:

First, edit one of the scripts, using the text editor of your choice.

Next, commit your changes using git:

* git add FILE_YOU_EDITED.sh
* git commit -m "A BRIEF MESSAGE EXPLAINING WHAT YOU CHANGED"
* git push

You should follow the above steps after every edit of the file. 


### Testing your scripts

It is your responsibility to test each script to verify that it functions correctly.
